#mern-stack

This is repository for mern-stack learning process notes.

In this till 3 commit I learned about the React (Basic templete, useState hook).
We learning it by creating a form which have input field for amount,desc,date all input is getting handeled by useState hook
and on submit we POST the input to backend by the server link (api){ we are fetch the url of api and by using method Post we transfer the input to backend or say firstly api then db }.
WE use CORS for intercommunication of cross platform for resource sharing.

In 4th commit we learned about getting data from frontend to backend.
we got form data from frontend to backend by req of Post of backend now we getting the data so we have to store it.

Now storing data in mongo db we need to create a schema for store data.
