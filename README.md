This is repository for mern-stack lreaning process notes.

In this till 3 commit I learned about the React (Basic templete, useState hook).
We learning it by creating a form which have input field for amount,desc,date all input is getting handeled by useState hook.
and on submit we POST the input to backend by the server link (api){ we are fetch the url of api and by using method Post we transfer the input to backend or say firstly api 
then db }. 
WE use CORS for intercommunication of cross platform for resource sharing.
